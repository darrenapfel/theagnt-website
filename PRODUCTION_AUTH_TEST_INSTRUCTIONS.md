# Production Authentication Test Instructions

## Issue Summary
Users with @theagnt.ai email addresses are not being redirected to the internal page after signing in. They still see the waitlist button instead of the special internal page.

## Debug Tools Available

### Option 1: Browser Console Test Script (Recommended)
1. Sign in to production with your @theagnt.ai email
2. Open browser console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `test-production-auth-enhanced.js`
4. Run: `testProductionAuth()`
5. Share the complete console output

### Option 2: Debug URL Parameter
1. Sign in to production with your @theagnt.ai email
2. Add `?debug=true` to the URL (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/dashboard?debug=true`)
3. Look for a small debug panel in the bottom right corner
4. Take a screenshot of the debug panel

### Option 3: Server Debug Page
1. Sign in to production
2. Navigate to `/debug/auth`
3. Take a screenshot of the entire page

## What We're Looking For

1. **Session Structure**: Is the email properly set in `session.user.email`?
2. **Email Format**: Is the email normalized correctly (lowercase, trimmed)?
3. **Domain Detection**: Is the domain being extracted as `theagnt.ai`?
4. **Redirect Logic**: Is the redirect being triggered but failing?

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected**: 
- Sign in with user@theagnt.ai → Redirected to `/internal` → See "this is a special page"

**Actual**: 
- Sign in with user@theagnt.ai → Stay on `/dashboard` → See waitlist button

## Quick Test Commands

If you have access to browser console:
```javascript
// Test domain validation directly
testDomainLogic("your-email@theagnt.ai")

// Check current session
fetch('/api/auth/session').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

## Potential Fixes

Based on test results, we may need to:
1. Fix session email passing from server to client
2. Adjust domain validation logic
3. Handle hydration mismatch between server and client
4. Fix NextAuth session structure in production

Please run any of these tests and share the results!
